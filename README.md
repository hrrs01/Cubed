Brainfuck With Method Support

Simply brainfuck with support for methods, and file opening. You can use files for external libraries, if used with a header, saying the byte count of it with a unicode character.

The new commands are "^" for running code from stack, and "~" for opening a file into the stack.

Read the code if you want to get a deeper understanding.

Run with:
```
python cubed.py test.txt
```
